# Input map.  This lists which antenna-polarizations were connected to which
# correlator inputs.  For dual-polarization inputs, the two polarization for a
# given input are flattened into two sequential elements, with the "first"
# polarization of the input given before the "second" polarization.  The
# antenna-polarization for an input is given as a two element array.  The first
# element specifies the antenna.  This can be given as a string for antenna
# name or an integer for antenna number.  The second element specifies the
# polarization.  Valid values are L,R,X,Y (case-insensitive).  Polarizations
# must be specified for each input, even for single polarization instruments.
